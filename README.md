# Scripts for: Vollger et al., 2023 Increased mutation rate and interlocus gene conversion within human segmental duplications                                                                                                  

The data used by these scripts is available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792653). Unzip data.zip in the base directory of the repo.                                                         

Most data is loaded by sourcing `load-data.R`; however, smaller files are sometimes loaded in within the markdown scripts. 
The dataset is quite large so the R-session needs to be opened on a machine with a large amount of memory (~100GB).
